The Structure of Packet
The kinds of packet are four which are for changing user interface, user interaction, and chapter.

1. "Change Page" packet (mobile <-> wearable)
When wearable application gets this packet from connected mobile application, the wearable application changes it's UI page such as attractor, decision, demo, and legal.
When mobile applicaiton gets this packet from connected wearable applicaiton, the mobile application chnages it's UI fragment such as attractor, decision, demo, and legal.
//json structure of "User Interface" packet
{
	header: {
		type: "CHANGE_PAGE"
	},
	data: {
		"nextPage": "NEXT PAGE",
		"transactionDir": "TRANSACTION DIR"
	}
}

2. "Ready to Demo" (mobile <- wearable)
When wearable application ready to demo, the wearable application sends this packet to mobile application.
//json structure of "Ready to Demo" packet
{
	header: {
		type: "READY_TO_DEMO_TO_MOBILE"
	},
	data: {
		"currentPage": "CURRENT PAGE"
	}
}

3. "Start Demo" (mobile -> wearable)
When wearable application ready to demo and mobile application get "Ready to Demo" pacekt from wearable application, mobile application sends this packet to start video demo.
//json structure of "Start Demo" packet
{
	header: {
		type: "START_DEMO_FROM_MOBILE"
	},
	data: {
		"currentPage": "CURRENT PAGE"
	}
}

4. "Notify Interaction to Mobile" packet (mobile <- wearable)
When wearable application gets user interaction, the wearable application send the interaction information to connected mobile application.
//json structure of "User Interface" packet
{
	header: {
		type: "NOTIFY_INTERACTION_TO_MOBILE"
	},
	data: {
		"currentPage": "CURRENT PAGE",
		"interaction": "USER INTERACTION TYPE"
		"chapterIndex": "CHAPTER INDEX"
		"extra": "EXTRA INFORMATION"
	}
}

5. "Chapter Item from Mobile" packet (mobile -> wearable)
When wearable application gets this packet from connected mobile application, the wearable application changes the chapter of current page.
The connected mobile application send this packet per one event real time.
//json structure of "Chapter Event" packet
{
	header: {
		type: "CHAPTER_ITEM_FROM_MOBILE"
	},
	data: {
		chapter {
			"chapterIndex": "CHAPTER INDEX"
			"chapterStart": "CHAPTER START",
			"chapterEnd": "CHAPTER END",
			"chapterAction": "CHAPTER ACTION",
			"chapterActionMessage": "CHAPTER ACTION MESSAGE"
		}
	}
}

6. "Change Page Analytics to Mobile" packet (mobile <- wearable)
: When page changed, wearable sends this packet to mobile in order to upload change page analytics data.
{
	header: {
		type: "CHANGE_PAGE_ANALYTICS_TO_MOBILE"
	},
	data: {
		"currentPage": "CURRENT PAGE",
		"nextPage": "NEXT PAGE",
		"interaction": "USER INTERACTION TYPE",
		"duration": "DURATION"
	}
}

7. "Notify Interaction Analytics to Mobile" packet (mobile <- wearable)
: When demo page gets user interaction, wearable sends this packet to mobile in order to upload user interaction analytics data.
{
	header: {
		type: "NOTIFY_INTERACTION_ANALYTICS_TO_MOBILE"
	},
	data: {
		"currentPage": "CURRENT PAGE",
		"interaction": "USER INTERACTION TYPE",
		"extra": "EXTRA INFORMATION"
	}
}

8. "Notify Chapter Change to Mobile" packet (mobile <- wearable)
